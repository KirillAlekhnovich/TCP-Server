Easy multithreaded TCP Server written in Java. 

## Task

Full task description can be found in [assignment](ASSIGNMENT.md) file.

## Requirements

* Java version: 17

## Testing

In order to test the application you have to compile it first (for example using javac) and then start it using `java Application ####` where `####` is port number you like.

When you start the application you can use pre-implemented [tester](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lBYQz50T-Ekq1LF9VM3jXWIMACLSlhNK?usp=sharing) in VirtualBox.
To run the tests type `tester #### 10.0.2.2` (`####` is port number) in testers' terminal. If you run into an error read [this](TESTER_ERROR_SOLVING.md) instruction to solve it.
